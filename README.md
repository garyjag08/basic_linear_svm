# Basic Linear SVM

This project demonstrates how to perform a basic linear Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Requirements

This project assumes a Jupyter Notebook environment for execution.

## Data Description

The example uses randomly generated data representing the dosage of a drug (units unspecified) and whether a patient was cured (yes or no). 

Please note that the data is randomly generated and does not reflect any real-world scenarios or validity.
